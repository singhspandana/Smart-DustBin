This project involves building a smart dustbin that automatically opens its lid when it detects a nearby object, like a hand. 
It uses an ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04) to measure the distance of the object.
When something comes within a set range, a servo motor is triggered to open the lid. 
After a short delay, the lid closes automatically.
This touchless system helps maintain cleanliness and hygiene, especially in public or household settings.
